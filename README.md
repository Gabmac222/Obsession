# Obsession

To create our program, we first conduct a search for required tools and libraries that are linked to our game engine and possibilities that can be created within a time limit. Following that, the main coder will decide what the game's possible functions are before proceeding to build the game using libraries. The story maker and scriptwriter will create the main guide, which will be followed by the game's artists, sound designers, and main coder. The tools listed will serve as the primary guideline and framework for creating the game.
Javascript – It is our go-to programming language for this project because it was mainly used by our game engine. Any related code, scripts and many more was built with this engine.
Autodesk: Sketchbook - Is used to draw and color character designs, but it can also be used to edit images for use in the game.
Ibis Paint X -    Has larger library of images for references to use in creating characters and background sceneries.
Photoshop CS6/Blender – The main coder mainly used Photoshop CCS6 and Blender to make the assets usable in the game if you have used our program.
RPG Maker MV – It is heavily used in this project in order to create our game called Obsession. It is a javascript based programming game engine that was released on 2016 to have better performance and functions that was incorporated in the game.
Android Studio/XCode – A compiler that was used to import the game for both IOS and Android Platforms.
The diagram below is the flowchart on how to play the game:
